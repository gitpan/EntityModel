	EntityModel::Entity
	* The ->new method has been expanded to accept a full entity definition
	* New ->keyfield for key-value storage types
	* Stringifies to entity:$name

	EntityModel::Field
	* Stringifies to field:$name

	EntityModel::Resolver
	* New class for providing helper functions for gathering values, might be renamed
	in future so don't get too comfortable

	Test::EntityModel
	* Helper module for setting up models and other common functions

	General:
	* ->find can now be run without parameters to return all objects. Not sure how advisable this
	is but presumably the caller knows what they're doing.
	* Fix loading JSON from file.
	* Automatically register plugins on load.
	* "Default" model support for classes such as EntityModel::Resolver
	* Drop DateTime::Format::Duration, seems to use $& in a croak statement and since we only use
	this as a helper module there's no great benefit in keeping it around.

	Bug fixes:
	* Fixes for hash ordering and smartmatch removal for building on perl-5.18, should close RT82151
	(thanks to Andreas J. KÃ¶nig for reporting).

	Documentation:
	* Yet more ORMs for the list
	* Sort out field names in example, thanks to Terrence Brannon for reporting this (a long time ago!)

0.017     2012-06-10 16:27:04 Europe/London

	Also added more ORMs to the "see also" section.

0.016     2012-03-05 01:25:35 Europe/London
	Another minor update with some code cleanup and preparation for some changes and minor
	restructuring planned for the next version:
	* Clean up several minor dependency issues (the deprecated EntityModel::DB class was trying to
	pull in DBI, and the SQL handling has a dependency on Parser::MGC).
	* Enable some additional dzil tests (mainly author tests for compiling modules, testing
	synopsis code, and the like)

0.015     2012-02-27 02:54:02 Europe/London
	This is a minor update only:
	* Fixes to tests and handling for EntityModel::Collection

0.012     2011-07-26 23:56:35 Europe/London

	Clean up module loading slightly.
	Disable log output in tests.
	Query interface uses PostgreSQL-style placeholders by default
	 (hardcoded, will eventually come from the engine instead)

	Attempt to fix test failure seen on Solaris where ref $v ~~ [...] was giving 'Argument "HASH" isn't numeric in
	 smart match', and associated v-string error (http://www.cpantesters.org/cpan/report/f86d3c52-3792-11e0-bb29-ad544afd17af)

0.005     2011-02-12 16:01:19 Europe/London

0.004     2011-02-06 06:02:05 Europe/London

	Preliminary release to CPAN.
