following optional named parameters:

=item * success - coderef to call on successful completion. The transaction will be committed
before this is called.

=item * failure - coderef to call on failure. This will be called after the transaction has
been rolled back.

=item * goodbye - coderef to call after success/failure. This will always be called regardless
of status, and can be used to chain events similar to L<CPS>.

Returns the transaction in list or scalar context, and in void
context will clean up the transaction automatically.
